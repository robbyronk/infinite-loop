    Only test stuff that is confusing and not brittle
        If your components are stupid simple, don't test them
        100% test coverage means when code changes, many tests need to change
        Tests are not free. At least, they cost time to write and time to maintain. They must save more time than they cost.
    Test sagas, reducers, selectors
        Plain objects in, plain objects out
        Fast and easy to test
