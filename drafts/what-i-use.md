    Editor: IntelliJ
        Understands every language
            Elixir with an open source plugin
            ES6 and JSX
        Connects to every database
        Amazing for Git
        Vim plugin has good reviews. I prefer to use the default keybindings with a few modifications.
            Ctrl Alt D should open the database connections. A very handy panel!
        Live templates, variable extraction, Ctrl W to select around cursor, block selection, move line, duplicate, delete line
        Spellcheck
