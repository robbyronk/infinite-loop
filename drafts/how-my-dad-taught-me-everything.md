- My dad likes to joke that he taught me everything I know
- It's a classic dad joke, but it's actually true
- He told me to "pick the brains of those around you"
- Everyone has something to teach you
- Ask questions and don't worry about what people will think
- People love to be experts, asking questions will make them feel good
