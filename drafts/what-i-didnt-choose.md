    Vue
        Looks nicer than React/Redux but has much less adoption and smaller ecosystem
    Immutable.js
        A real pain every time you want to get or set data, including with other libraries
    TypeScript
        Most React examples use ES6
    CSS Modules, etc
        CSS is still largely undecided in React and the old way still works fine enough
    Python/Rails/PHP/Node
        Python is fragmented into async and non-async
            Non-async is standard and slow
            Async is weird and non-standard
        Rails is slow. Everything works well though
        PHP is fast and getting better all the time. I still can't though. I don't think there's a good websocket setup.
        Node is fine. Large projects get unruly and the ecosystem isn't mature (see leftpad)
